# Algorithms

##

Using tangram shapes and graph paper will show how important it is to make each instruction as clear and unambiguous as possible.

##

Exploring how many ways paper can be folded into a rectangle shows how some methods can be more efficient than others.

# Objective

-  Explain that the same thing can be accomplished many different ways, and
sometimes there are “better” ways than others.
- Practice creating algorithms that describe real-world directions
- Learn to think about solving a problem many different ways
- Think about creating more “efficient” solutions to problems

# Materials

- Tangram Image Pack
- Tangram Pieces
- Graph paper (five or six sheets per pair)
- One piece of blank paper

# Vocabulary

## Algorithm

A series of instructions on how to accomplish a task

## Ambiguous

Having more than one meaning

## Efficiency

Having the best outcome for the least amount of work

## Evaluate

To work at an answer

## Hamburger Fold

To fold a paper in half the wide way

## Hot Dog Fold

To fold a paper in half the long way

# Review and Extend

## In Stage 5, The Artist, we drew simple shapes using code blocks

##

- What did the set color block do?
- How would we use what we learned last time to make a square with different
colors on all sides?

Not only can a computer “misunderstand” what you mean for it to do, but you can tell a computer to do the same thing several different ways.

## Tangrams

Tangrams are a Chinese geometric puzzle consisting of a square cut into seven pieces that can be arranged to make various other shapes. Our activity has been designed to use the same Tangram pieces as the classic puzzle, but with a twist. We won’t require the use of every single piece each time, and we will be laying our shapes out on graph paper.

## Computer instructions

Computers "understand" things differently than we do. Partly, this is because computers can't "guess" what we want based on our tone of voice or our body language. If you tell your friend "Aperture is a hard word. Can you spell that?"" It is very likely that your friend will try to spell "aperture."" If your friend is a computer, however, it would probably spell the word "that." If you give an ambiguous instruction, a computer will
evaluate it the way it has been told to, whether it is what you meant or not.

# Activity for 2 persons

##

1. The *programmer* and the *computer* sit back to back
2. The *programmer* selects a completed picture of shapes
3. The *programmer* uses words and phrases to direct the *computer* to rebuild the original image (sound effects or body movements are not allowed)
4. The *computer* uses the packet of shapes, graph paper and the spoken instructions to build the image

##

5. Compare the images
6. Discuss which instructions worked well and which did not
7. Switch roles and repeat steps 1-6 with a new picture

# Repeats

##

Can you think of an easier way to notate _back, back, back_ or _move forward
and fill 5 times_?

##

Look at these “functions.” What do you suppose they do?

![](images/stage5repeats.jpg)

## Answers

1. Move forward six spaces
2. Color 6 blocks in a row
3. Color a diagonal line

# Activity

1. Write a program for a medium size image
2. Exchange your program with another coder
3. Draw the image from the program
4. Verify the image with the original coder
5. Repeat steps 1-4 with a large size image

# Wrap up

## Objectives

-  Understand the difficulty of translating real problems into programs
- Learn that ideas may feel clear to them, and still be misinterpreted by
 a computer
- Realize the need for formal programming structures like loops and functions

## Vocabulary

- **Algorithm**: A series of instructions on how to accomplish a task
- **Coding**: Transforming actions into a symbolic language
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing problems in code
- **Function**: A piece of code that can be called over and over
- **Parameters**: Extra bits of information that you can pass into a function
